# Nested Folders & Drag-and-Drop Requirements

## Project Overview

Transform the current flat folder structure R2 Image Browser into a full hierarchical folder system with browser-based drag-and-drop support for entire folder trees, including automated folder creation and nested file organization.

## 1. Functional Requirements

### 1.1 Hierarchical Folder Structure

#### FR-1.1.1 Nested Folder Support
- **Requirement**: System MUST support unlimited folder nesting depth
- **Current State**: Only single-level folders (e.g., `folder1/`, `folder2/`)
- **Target State**: Multi-level nesting (e.g., `categories/animals/mammals/cats/`)
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Users can create folders within existing folders
  - System maintains folder hierarchy in R2 bucket using forward-slash delimited object keys
  - No practical limit on nesting depth (subject to R2 key length limits)

#### FR-1.1.2 Folder Navigation
- **Requirement**: Users MUST be able to navigate through folder hierarchy
- **Features**:
  - Breadcrumb navigation showing current path
  - Click-to-navigate to parent folders
  - Forward/back navigation support
  - Tree view for folder structure overview
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Breadcrumb displays current location (e.g., Home > Categories > Animals > Cats)
  - Each breadcrumb segment is clickable for direct navigation
  - Tree view shows expandable/collapsible folder structure

### 1.2 Drag-and-Drop Folder Upload

#### FR-1.2.1 Folder Detection
- **Requirement**: System MUST detect when user drags a folder vs individual files
- **Technical Approach**: Use `webkitGetAsEntry()` API for folder detection
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - System distinguishes between file drops and folder drops
  - Folder drops trigger hierarchical processing
  - Mixed drops (files + folders) are handled appropriately

#### FR-1.2.2 Recursive Folder Processing
- **Requirement**: System MUST recursively process all files within dropped folders
- **Features**:
  - Traverse entire folder tree structure
  - Maintain relative folder paths during upload
  - Handle nested folders of any depth
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - All files in folder hierarchy are identified for upload
  - Original folder structure is preserved
  - Empty folders are represented (using placeholder files if necessary)

#### FR-1.2.3 Folder Structure Preview
- **Requirement**: Users MUST see folder structure before confirming upload
- **Features**:
  - Tree view of folders and files to be uploaded
  - File count and total size per folder
  - Ability to exclude specific files/folders from upload
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Visual representation shows folder hierarchy
  - Users can deselect items before upload
  - Summary shows total files, folders, and size

### 1.3 Enhanced Upload Processing

#### FR-1.3.1 Batch Upload with Progress
- **Requirement**: System MUST handle large folder uploads efficiently
- **Features**:
  - Progress tracking per folder and overall
  - Chunked upload processing to prevent timeouts
  - Pause/resume functionality for large uploads
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Progress bars show folder-level and file-level progress
  - Users can pause and resume uploads
  - System handles network interruptions gracefully

#### FR-1.3.2 Conflict Resolution
- **Requirement**: System MUST handle file/folder name conflicts
- **Features**:
  - Detect existing files with same names
  - Offer rename, skip, or overwrite options
  - Bulk conflict resolution for multiple files
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Users are prompted for conflict resolution strategy
  - Bulk actions available for multiple conflicts
  - Upload continues after conflict resolution

### 1.4 Folder Management Operations

#### FR-1.4.1 Nested Folder Creation
- **Requirement**: Users MUST be able to create folders within existing folders
- **Features**:
  - Create folder dialog with parent folder selection
  - Validation for folder names and hierarchy
  - Auto-creation of intermediate folders if needed
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Folder creation works at any hierarchy level
  - Invalid characters are rejected with clear error messages
  - Path length limitations are enforced

#### FR-1.4.2 Recursive Folder Operations
- **Requirement**: Folder operations MUST work on entire folder trees
- **Operations**:
  - Delete: Remove folder and all contents
  - Rename: Update folder name and all child paths
  - Move: Relocate folder tree to new parent
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Delete operations show file count before confirmation
  - Rename operations update all child object keys
  - Move operations maintain folder structure

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Performance Requirements

#### NFR-2.1.1 Upload Performance
- **Requirement**: Large folder uploads MUST complete within reasonable timeframes
- **Metrics**:
  - 1000 files: Complete within 10 minutes
  - 100MB total size: Complete within 5 minutes
  - UI responsiveness maintained during uploads
- **Implementation**: Chunked uploads, progress streaming, background processing

#### NFR-2.1.2 Navigation Performance
- **Requirement**: Folder navigation MUST be responsive
- **Metrics**:
  - Folder listing: < 2 seconds
  - Breadcrumb navigation: Immediate response
  - Tree view expansion: < 1 second
- **Implementation**: Lazy loading, caching, optimistic UI updates

### 2.2 Browser Compatibility

#### NFR-2.2.1 Modern Browser Support
- **Requirement**: MUST support all modern browsers
- **Targets**:
  - Chrome 90+ (webkitGetAsEntry support)
  - Firefox 88+ (DataTransfer API support)
  - Safari 14+ (partial support with fallbacks)
  - Edge 90+ (Chromium-based)
- **Fallbacks**: Input element with `webkitdirectory` for unsupported browsers

#### NFR-2.2.2 Progressive Enhancement
- **Requirement**: Core functionality MUST work without advanced APIs
- **Approach**:
  - Graceful degradation for drag-and-drop
  - Alternative upload methods for unsupported browsers
  - Clear messaging about browser capabilities

### 2.3 Security Requirements

#### NFR-2.3.1 Path Validation
- **Requirement**: All folder/file paths MUST be validated and sanitized
- **Controls**:
  - Prevent path traversal attacks (../../../)
  - Sanitize special characters in folder names
  - Enforce maximum path length limits
- **Implementation**: Server-side validation, path sanitization functions

#### NFR-2.3.2 File Type Validation
- **Requirement**: Upload restrictions MUST be enforced for nested folders
- **Controls**:
  - Maintain existing image-only restriction
  - Validate file types for all files in folder tree
  - Reject folders containing invalid file types
- **Implementation**: Recursive file type checking, clear error messages

### 2.4 Scalability Requirements

#### NFR-2.4.1 R2 Storage Efficiency
