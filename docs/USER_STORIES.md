## Core User Stories

### Epic 1: Folder Hierarchy Navigation

#### **Story 1.1: Browse Nested Folders**
**As a** content manager  
**I want to** navigate through nested folder structures

And the URL should reflect the current path
```

**Scenario 1.1.2: Deep Navigation**
```
Given I am in "Categories > Animals > Mammals"
When I click on "Categories" in the breadcrumb
