# Test Results Summary

## ✅ Successfully Implemented Testing Suite

### Core Functionality Tests: **PASSING** ✅

All essential backend functionality has been thoroughly tested and is working correctly:

#### **Path Validation & Security** ✅
- ✅ Safe path validation (folders, subfolders)
- ✅ Path traversal attack prevention (`../` injection)
- ✅ Double slash prevention (`//` injection)
- ✅ Invalid character filtering

#### **File Upload Processing** ✅
- ✅ Valid file upload (JPEG, PNG, GIF, SVG, WebP)
- ✅ File type validation and rejection of dangerous files
- ✅ File size limits (10MB maximum)
- ✅ Conflict resolution strategies:
  - ✅ Rename (adds -1, -2, etc.)
  - ✅ Skip existing files
  - ✅ Overwrite existing files

#### **Folder Hierarchy Management** ✅
- ✅ Correct folder structure building from flat file lists
- ✅ File count aggregation per folder
- ✅ Nested folder support (unlimited depth)
- ✅ Alphabetical sorting of folders and files

#### **R2 Bucket Operations** ✅
- ✅ File storage with metadata
- ✅ File retrieval with size and metadata
- ✅ Prefix-based listing and filtering
- ✅ Proper size calculation for ArrayBuffer data

#### **Batch Upload Integration** ✅
- ✅ Multiple file processing
- ✅ Folder structure preservation during upload
- ✅ Mixed success/failure handling
- ✅ Proper response formatting

#### **End-to-End Workflows** ✅
- ✅ Complete upload → list → navigate workflow
- ✅ Hierarchical folder creation and retrieval
- ✅ Integration between upload and folder listing APIs
